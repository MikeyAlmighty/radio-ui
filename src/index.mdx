# Getting Started

School Bus is the [Lesson Desk](https://www.lessondesk.com/) component library. It enables the [Lesson Desk](https://www.lessondesk.com/) team to build better products by providing a consistent & reusable set of base components.

It's main goals are:
- **Consistency**. Providing predictable patterns and behavior.
- **Flexible**. Providing the required functionality regardless of product.
- **Reusable**. A base set of components that can be reused in many contexts.
